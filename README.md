# react-redux-demo

This is a very simple React app with some buttons to increase or decrease a counter.
Using: 
- Redux for state management
- Redux-thunk for async actions
- Axios for fetching a value from an external API [random-int-api](https://github.com/roelver/random-int-api) that is [running on Heroku](https://sleepy-bastion-57253.herokuapp.com/).
